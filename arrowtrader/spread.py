"""The spread the ladder displays, built from two ticks.

    spread = P_B - beta * P_A

Leg B minus the hedge ratio times leg A, and nothing else. The hedge
ratio is the same number that sizes the hedge, so the spread is exactly
the P&L of the pair per unit — which is why beta is structural and
cannot change under an open position.

PORTED FROM MT5-Trader's `spread.py`, DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED. The
arithmetic is exchange-agnostic: two ticks in, one snapshot out. Every
rule in here came out of a live loss in the system MT5-Trader was
itself ported from, and none of them is about MetaTrader — the mid
comes from the BOOK, a level is read on the EXECUTABLE side for its own
direction, and a position reads the opposite executable side to close.

What IS different here is upstream: on Arrow a tick's `bid` or `ask`
can be None (see `quotes.py`), where MT5 always had both. So
`compute_spread` refuses a tick it cannot price rather than reading
None as zero — which would put the spread at `-beta x ask_A` and draw
a perfectly plausible ladder around a number that means nothing.
