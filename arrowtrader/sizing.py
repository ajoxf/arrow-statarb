"""How many lots each leg trades, and what one unit of Qty is worth.

## THE TRADER TYPES BOTH LEGS

`clip_lots_a` and `clip_lots_b` are what ONE unit of the Qty box means
on each leg, and both are typed. Qty 100 at 1 and 1 is 100 lots of leg
A against 100 lots of leg B; at 1 and 2 it is 100 against 200. Nothing
is derived, and nothing is matched on the desk's behalf.

That is a deliberate reversal. Leg B used to be computed — from the
hedge arithmetic, or lot for lot, or by equal notional — and every one
of those could round a leg to zero, disagree with what the trader
believed they were trading, or refuse to size at all. A number typed
into a box can do none of those things.

## WHAT THAT COSTS, SAID PLAINLY

`k = L_B * C_B` is the dollars-per-1.00-of-spread multiplier, and it is
LEG B's units. Every conversion from spread to money uses this one `k`:
the ladder's per-tick value, the working order's notional, the
position's P&L, the fees.

The spread is `S = P_B - beta * P_A`, and a move gives exactly `-dS * k`
only when `L_A * C_A = beta * L_B * C_B`. Typed lots are under no
obligation to satisfy that, so on a pair where they do not, part of the
position is an outright in the underlying rather than a spread. That is
the trader's choice to make — they typed both numbers — and the P&L
this system reports is still the spread's, computed from `k`.

`L_B = L_A * beta` would be wrong for that identity, and was wrong in
the stat-arb engine this is ported from: at beta 2 the matching hedge
is HALF leg A's lots, and the naive rule traded double. It is recorded
here because the arithmetic still governs what `k` means, even though
nothing computes a hedge from it any more.

## WHAT CHANGES ON ARROW, AND IT IS THE DANGEROUS PART

`C` is `LotSize` — UNITS PER LOT, from the instrument master, and it
VARIES PER EXPIRY (NSE revises lot sizes between contracts; MCX's mini
contracts are a different size again). `k` is rupees per 1.00 of
spread.

**Lots are whole.** There is no 0.01 lot: `volume_step` and
`volume_min` are both 1, and `round_step(down=True)` on leg B still
matters because short is the recoverable error.

**And the order carries UNITS, not lots.** `quantity = lots * LotSize`.
That conversion happens once, in the broker module, and `units()` below
is the only place it is written down. Get it wrong and the first live
order is `LotSize` times the intended size — 100x on GOLD, 30x on
SILVER — and it does not fail, it fills.

A lot size that could not be resolved is **None**, and None REFUSES.
It is never 1. `arrow_statarb`'s `resolve_lot_size` falls back to 1
with a warning, and against this arithmetic that fallback is the
hundredfold error itself.
